<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

      <h2>Dune</h2>
      <p id="duneText" class="paragraph">
        The Dune series by Frank Herbert is a groundbreaking and influential science fiction epic that explores a complex and vividly imagined universe. The first novel, "Dune," introduces readers to the desert planet of Arrakis, the only source of the valuable spice melange. The narrative follows the noble House Atreides and its young heir, Paul Atreides, as they navigate political intrigue, ecological challenges, and the mystical elements tied to the spice. Herbert's intricate world-building, political intricacies, and philosophical themes, including the concept of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood and the messianic figure Muad'Dib, contribute to the series' enduring legacy. Spanning multiple generations and delving into themes of power, religion, and environmentalism, the Dune series stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of science fiction literature.
